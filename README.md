# croskeyboard3
HID Keyboard driver with function keys for Chromebooks that use the Chromium EC, with a Poker2-based layout.

# Compatibility
Works on the Chromebook Pixel and any chromebook released after the Pixel.

# Function key mapping

The top row (brightness, volume, etc) keys now work like they do in ChromeOS, requiring no modifiers to be held to use them.

Search = Win

Shift + Search = CapsLock

Alt + Refresh = Alt + Fullscreen = Alt + F4

Ctrl + Alt + Backspace = Ctrl + Alt + Delete

Ctrl + Alt + Up    = Page Up

Ctrl + Alt + Down  = Page Down

Ctrl + Alt + Left  = Home

Ctrl + Alt + Right = End

Right Control also functions as a "Fn" key:

Fn + 1 = F1

Fn + 2 = F2

Fn + 3 = F3

Fn + 4 = F4

Fn + 5 = F5

Fn + 6 = F6

Fn + 7 = F7

Fn + 8 = F8

Fn + 9 = F9

Fn + 0 = F10

Fn + "-/_" = F11

Fn + "=/+" = F12

Fn + [ = Scroll Lock

Fn + ] = Pause/Break

Fn + ' = Page Up
